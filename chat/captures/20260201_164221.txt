I've created a comprehensive README.md file for your GitHub repository. It includes:

- Clear overview and feature list
- Installation instructions with optional key binding
- Usage examples for both single and multiple links
- Sample output messages
- Requirements and compatibility information
- Technical details about the implementation
- Credits to the original Stack Exchange post
- Sections for licensing and contributing

The README is formatted in standard GitHub markdown style and should render nicely on your repository page. Feel free to modify any sections to better match your preferences!
