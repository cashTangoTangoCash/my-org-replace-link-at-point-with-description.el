Great idea! Here's the enhanced version with detailed reporting:

```elisp
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description (&optional beg end)
  "Replace org link(s) by description or address.
With region active, replace all links in region."
  (interactive (when (use-region-p)
                 (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
  
  (cond
   ;; Case 1: Region is active - replace all links in region
   ((and beg end)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (let ((count 0))
          (goto-char beg)
          (while (re-search-forward org-link-bracket-re end t)
            (let* ((original (match-string-no-properties 0))
                   (description (or (match-string-no-properties 2)
                                    (match-string-no-properties 1))))
              (replace-match description)
              (setq count (1+ count))
              (message "Link %d: [[%s]] → %s" 
                       count 
                       (substring original 2 -2)  ; Remove [[ and ]]
                       description)))
          (message "Replaced %d link%s" 
                   count 
                   (if (= count 1) "" "s"))))))
   
   ;; Case 2: Point is on a link - replace just this link
   ((org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (let* ((original (match-string-no-properties 0))
               (link-start (match-beginning 0))
               (link-end (match-end 0))
               (description (if (match-end 2)
                                (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                              (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
          (delete-region link-start link-end)
          (insert description)
          (message "Replaced: [[%s]] → %s" 
                   (substring original 2 -2)  ; Remove [[ and ]]
                   description)))))
   
   ;; Case 3: Not on a link - inform user
   (t
    (message "Not on an org link"))))
```

## What you'll see in *Messages*:

**For a single link:**
```
Replaced: [[https://example.com][Example Site]] → Example Site
```

**For multiple links in a region:**
```
Link 1: [[https://example.com][Example]] → Example
Link 2: [[https://gnu.org][GNU]] → GNU  
Link 3: [[https://emacs.org]] → https://emacs.org
Replaced 3 links
```

The messages show:
- The original link (without the outer `[[` and `]]`)
- The arrow `→` 
- What it was replaced with
- A count summary at the end for multiple links

This makes it easy to review what happened and catch any unexpected results!
