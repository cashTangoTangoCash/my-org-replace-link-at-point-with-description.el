Excellent point - you're being appropriately careful about licensing!Great question! Based on the search results, here's what you need to know:

## Stack Exchange Licensing

User contributions on Stack Exchange since May 2, 2018 are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0). For older content, CC BY-SA 3.0 applies.

## What this means for you:

**You CAN use and modify the code**, but you must:

1. **Provide attribution** - Link back to the original Stack Exchange post and credit the author
2. **Share-Alike** - Your modified version must be published under a compatible license (share-alike requirement, similar to GPL)

## The licensing problem:

There is currently no non-CC license that Creative Commons considers 'share-alike' compatible with CC BY-SA 3.0. This means:

- **You CANNOT relicense it as MIT** - MIT is permissive, not share-alike compatible
- **You CANNOT relicense it as Apache or BSD** - These are also permissive licenses
- **GPL might work** - GPL is copyleft and *might* be considered compatible, but there's legal uncertainty
- **The safest option: Keep it CC BY-SA** - Use the same license as the original

## My recommendation:

Update the README to use **CC BY-SA 4.0** (or 3.0 to match the original post date) and provide proper attribution. Here's what the license section should say:

```markdown

Would you like me to update the README with the correct licensing information?
