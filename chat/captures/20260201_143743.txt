Great question! Here's how to properly comment it for your .el file:

```elisp
;; Replace org links with their descriptions
;; Based on: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10707/in-org-mode-how-to-remove-a-link
;;
;; Usage examples:
;; - Place cursor on a link and call the function to unlink it
;; - Select a region containing multiple links to unlink all of them
;;
;; What you'll see in *Messages*:
;;
;; For a single link:
;;   Replaced: [[https://example.com][Example Site]] → Example Site
;;
;; For multiple links in a region:
;;   Link 1: [[https://example.com][Example]] → Example
;;   Link 2: [[https://gnu.org][GNU]] → GNU  
;;   Link 3: [[https://emacs.org]] → https://emacs.org
;;   Replaced 3 links

(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description (&optional beg end)
  "Replace org link(s) by description or address.

  (interactive (when (use-region-p)
                 (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
  
  (cond
   ;; Case 1: Region is active - replace all links in region
   ((and beg end)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (let ((count 0))
          (goto-char beg)
          (while (re-search-forward org-link-bracket-re end t)
            (let* ((original (match-string-no-properties 0))
                   (description (or (match-string-no-properties 2)
                                    (match-string-no-properties 1))))
              (replace-match description)
              (setq count (1+ count))
              (message "Link %d: [[%s]] → %s" 
                       count 
                       (substring original 2 -2)

                   (if (= count 1) "" "s"))))))
   
   ;; Case 2: Point is on a link - replace just this link
   ((org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (let* ((original (match-string-no-properties 0))
               (link-start (match-beginning 0))
               (link-end (match-end 0))
               (description (if (match-end 2)
                                (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                              (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
          (delete-region link-start link-end)
          (insert description)
          (message "Replaced: [[%s]] → %s" 
                   (substring original 2 -2)
                   description)))))
   
   ;; Case 3: Not on a link - inform user
   (t
    (message "Not on an org link"))))
```

## Key points:

1. **`;;` for comment lines** - Each line starts with `;;` (double semicolon)
2. **Header comments** - Explain what the code does and provide usage examples
3. **Inline comments** - Already in the code with single `;` after code or `;;` for case labels
4. **Docstring** - The string right after `defun` that describes the function

This follows standard Emacs Lisp commenting conventions!
