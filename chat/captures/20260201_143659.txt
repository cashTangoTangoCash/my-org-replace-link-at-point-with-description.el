You're absolutely right! Lisp's nested parentheses can be hard to follow. Let me rewrite it with better structure and comments:

```elisp
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description (&optional beg end)
  "Replace org link(s) by description or address.
With region active, replace all links in region."
  (interactive (when (use-region-p)
                 (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
  
  (cond
   ;; Case 1: Region is active - replace all links in region
   ((and beg end)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (goto-char beg)
        (while (re-search-forward org-link-bracket-re end t)
          (let ((description (or (match-string-no-properties 2)
                                 (match-string-no-properties 1))))
            (replace-match description))))))
   
   ;; Case 2: Point is on a link - replace just this link
   ((org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
    (save-excursion
      (atomic-change-group
        (let* ((link-start (match-beginning 0))
               (link-end (match-end 0))
               (description (if (match-end 2)
                                (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                              (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
          (delete-region link-start link-end)
          (insert description)))))
   
   ;; Case 3: Not on a link - inform user
   (t
    (message "Not on an org link"))))
```

## Key readability improvements:

1. **`cond` instead of nested `if`** - Makes the three cases explicit
2. **Extracted variable** - `description` is clearer than inline `or`
3. **Named let bindings** - `link-start` and `link-end` instead of a list
4. **Comments** - Each case labeled
5. **Whitespace** - Blank lines separate the three cases

Much easier to see the logic flow now, right?
