Yes, a few enhancements come to mind:

1. **Better error handling** - Currently, if you're not on a link, nothing happens silently. You could add user feedback:

```elisp
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description ()
  "Replace an org link by its description or if empty its address"
  (interactive)
  (if (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
      (save-excursion
        (let ((remove (list (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
              (description
               (if (match-end 2) 
                   (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                 (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
          (apply 'delete-region remove)
          (insert description)))
    (message "Not on an org link")))  ; Added feedback
```

2. **Region support** - Allow unlinking multiple links at once:

```elisp
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description (&optional beg end)
  "Replace org link(s) by description or address.
With region active, replace all links in region."
  (interactive (when (use-region-p)
                 (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
  (if (and beg end)
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char beg)
        (while (re-search-forward org-link-bracket-re end t)
          (replace-match
           (or (match-string-no-properties 2)
               (match-string-no-properties 1)))))
    ;; Single link at point
    (if (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
        (save-excursion
          (let ((remove (list (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
                (description
                 (if (match-end 2) 
                     (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                   (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
            (apply 'delete-region remove)
            (insert description)))
      (message "Not on an org link"))))
```

3. **Undo as single operation** - Wrap in `atomic-change-group` so undo reverts the whole operation:

```elisp
(atomic-change-group
  (apply 'delete-region remove)
  (insert description))
```

Would any of these be useful for your workflow?
