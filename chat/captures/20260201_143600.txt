can you check this emacs lisp function - does it need updating for emacs 30.2?  

;; https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10707/in-org-mode-how-to-remove-a-link
;; The following elisp function will take a link around the current
;; point as recognised by org-bracket-link-regexp, so either
;; [[Link][Description]] or [[Link]], and replace it by Description in
;; the first case or Link in the second case.
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description ()
    "Replace an org link by its description or if empty its address"
  (interactive)
  (if (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
      (save-excursion
        (let ((remove (list (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
              (description
               (if (match-end 2) 
                   (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                 (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
          (apply 'delete-region remove)
          (insert description)))))
