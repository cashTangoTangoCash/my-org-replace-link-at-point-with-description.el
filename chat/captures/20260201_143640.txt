Absolutely! Here's the enhanced version with `atomic-change-group` added:

```elisp
(defun my/org-replace-link-by-link-description (&optional beg end)
  "Replace org link(s) by description or address.
With region active, replace all links in region."
  (interactive (when (use-region-p)
                 (list (region-beginning) (region-end))))
  (if (and beg end)
      ;; Multiple links in region
      (save-excursion
        (atomic-change-group
          (goto-char beg)
          (while (re-search-forward org-link-bracket-re end t)
            (replace-match
             (or (match-string-no-properties 2)
                 (match-string-no-properties 1))))))
    ;; Single link at point
    (if (org-in-regexp org-link-bracket-re 1)
        (save-excursion
          (atomic-change-group
            (let ((remove (list (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
                  (description
                   (if (match-end 2) 
                       (org-match-string-no-properties 2)
                     (org-match-string-no-properties 1))))
              (apply 'delete-region remove)
              (insert description))))
      (message "Not on an org link"))))
```

## Key changes:

1. **Region case**: Wrapped the entire `goto-char` + `while` loop in `atomic-change-group` so all link replacements in the region undo as one operation

2. **Single link case**: Same as before - wraps both the deletion and insertion

Now whether you're unlinking one link or ten, a single undo will revert all the changes!
