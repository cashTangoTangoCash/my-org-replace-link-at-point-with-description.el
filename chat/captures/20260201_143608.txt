I'll check this Emacs Lisp function for compatibility with Emacs 30.2.Good news! Your function looks compatible with Emacs 30.2. Based on the search results, here's what I found:

**The function should work fine** - the key variable `org-link-bracket-re` that your function uses is the current standard as of Org 9.3+ (from 2019).

**Historical context:**
- Prior to Org 9.3, the variable was called `org-bracket-link-regexp`, but it's now an alias for `org-link-bracket-re`
- Your code already uses the modern name `org-link-bracket-re`, so you're good

**The match groups are correct:**
- Match group 1 contains the link target/URL and match group 2 contains the description, which is exactly what your function expects
- Your function correctly checks `(match-end 2)` to see if a description exists

The only minor consideration: if you want to support very old Org mode versions (pre-9.3, before 2019), you could add a compatibility check, but for Emacs 30.2 this is completely unnecessary.

**Bottom line:** No changes needed! Your function should work perfectly with Emacs 30.2.
